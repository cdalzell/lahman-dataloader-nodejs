Lahman Database Loader - Node.js
=========

This is a project to create a Node.js utility to load data from the Lahman Baseball Database source files into a variety of databases.

This is a work in progress, but the first three I intend to look at are (in order):
* MongoDB (Yes, I'm aware of mongoimport)
* MariaDB/MySQL
* Postgres

The home of and source data for the Lahman Database can be found here: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
